Uniswap v4 Core Audit − Scope − 6

System Overview
Uniswap v4 is an automated market maker (AMM) which uses the concentrated liquidity model
by default but can be customized to use any other model. Such customizations are possible
because of the hooks that are executed before and after every user action. Other significant
changes compared to v3 include singleton architecture, flash accounting, dynamic liquidity
providers fee, donation to liquidity providers, and native token support. Finally, the new version
uses several techniques to reduce gas usage. The entry point to the Uniswap v4 core is the
singleton PoolManager contract which contains all the pools within itself. This contrasts with
the previous versions of the protocol which had the factory contract deploying individual pools
as separate contracts.
Hooks are functions of the Hooks contract which is specified at the pool initialization time.
These functions are called by the PoolManager before and after each swap, position
modification, donation, and pool initialization. The available hooks are beforeInitialize
and afterInitialize, which are called during pool initialization, beforeAddLiquidity,
afterAddLiquidity, beforeRemoveLiquidity and afterRemoveLiquidity which
are called when changing liquidity positions, beforeDonate and afterDonate, which are
called when donating assets to LPs, and beforeSwap and afterSwap, which are called
when performing swaps. Some hooks, namely beforeSwap, afterSwap, and
afterModifyLiquidity, return parameters which might influence the PoolManager's
control flow. The lower bits of the hook address decide which hooks are enabled. Thus, to have
a particular set of hooks enabled, one must brute-force the address whose lower bits are the
desired bit sequence.
Flash accounting means that all operations within the protocol are performed on transient
storage and should be settled only at the end of the transaction. Settlement can be
accomplished by either ERC-20 token transfers or ERC-6909 accounting. The latter allows
users to keep their token inside Uniswap v4 for future use which is cheaper in terms of gas
compared to ERC-20 transfers. One consequence of the flash accounting mechanism is free
flash loans. Furthermore, since all the pools reside in the singleton contract, it is possible to
flash borrow the whole balance of a token at once.
The liquidity provider fee is now more customizable and can be of either static or dynamic type
which is specified at the pool initialization time. Both fees can take values from 0 to 100% with
a precision of 0.01%. The static fee is set once and cannot be changed whereas the dynamic
Uniswap v4 Core Audit − System Overview − 7

fee can be changed by the hook at any time, either for all transactions or per transaction. Note
that a hook might charge its own fees from users and liquidity providers on swaps and position
modifications which is done via a separate mechanism. The donate function can be used to
send tokens to the singleton contract and distribute those to the liquidity providers whose
liquidity is currently in use. Native tokens like ETH are supported, allowing users to avoid
wrapping and unwrapping tokens. Gas optimizations include the already mentioned use of
transient storage as well as more widespread techniques like extensive use of assembly,
custom packed types (both in-storage and in-memory), low-level memory management and
unchecked math.
Whether it is adding or removing liquidity, doing swaps, or donating, the user always needs to
call the unlock function first. This function will set an unlock variable to true and will call
back the msg.sender at a specified function. This callback is what is actually used by the
caller to call either modifyLiquidity, donate or swap. Since these operations might
produce changes in the amount of assets owed to the protocol or the user through the use of
balance deltas, once the callback is done, the unlock function will perform a check on those
deltas and will make sure that they have been zeroed out before finishing the transaction. In
this way, the protocol ensures that no debt or credit is left behind.
Because of all this, the take and settle functions are needed. The take function will
withdraw assets from the protocol so that any asset owed to the user is given to them.
Conversely, the settle function will ensure that the user transfers to the protocol all the
assets owed to it. If one does not want to take or settle, the ERC-6909 mint and burn
functions can be used instead with the same desired effect of balancing the deltas.
Finally, the sync function is used to update the current protocol balance of any particular
asset. This is necessary to be performed before transferring tokens to the protocol and calling
the settle function.
Uniswap v4 Core Audit − System Overview − 8

Security Model and Trust
Assumptions
The following observations were made regarding the security model and trust assumptions of
the audited codebase:
• The core contract does not have slippage protection and assumes that the periphery
contracts implement it. Hence, having slippage protection on the periphery contracts is
essential.
• ERC-20 tokens with non-standard implementation including rebasing tokens, double
entry point tokens, and so forth or outright malicious tokens are not supported by the
protocol and will lead to vulnerabilities in the pools they are used in.
• Malicious hooks might steal tokens from users and liquidity providers in multiple ways. A
variety of user risks can be mitigated by implementing slippage protection on periphery
contracts, but liquidity provider risks are not mitigated in the same manner. Thus,
liquidity providers should examine hooks more closely and put more trust into them.
Even though hooks are set at initialization time, they might be upgradeable, and in this
case, be able to change their code at later point in time.
• Since Uniswap v4 is permissionless anyone can create a pool with any token. It is up to
the periphery contracts, users and liquidity providers to examine and decide which pools
they want to use. The core contract, however, limits the impact of malicious tokens and
malicious hooks on the pool they are used in by ensuring that each function operates
only within the particular pool and separating the accounting of each pool in storage,
separating also the balance deltas produced by hooks and by users.
Privileged Roles
On the protocol level, there are two privileged roles which are trusted to not behave
maliciously: the protocol fee controller and the owner. The former can set the protocol fee on
any pool but the fee is capped at 0.1%. It also can collect accumulated protocol fees to an
arbitrary address. The latter can change the protocol fee controller.
On the individual pool level, the hook can change the liquidity provider fee but only if the pool
was initialized with the dynamic fee in the first place.

Critical Severity
C-01 ERC-20 Representation of Native Currency
Can Be Used to Drain Native Currency Pools
The settle function, responsible for settling a user's debt, increases the account delta of the
specified currency. There are two settlement flows: one for the native currency and another for
all other currencies. If the currency is native, the amount used for increasing the delta is
msg.value. Otherwise, if the currency is a regular ERC-20 token, the amount is the balance
difference between the last time sync or settle were called and the current settle
invocation.
This implementation is vulnerable to attacks if the given token has two addresses. This is
particularly dangerous since the protocol supports native tokens and operates on chains where
the native token has a corresponding ERC-20 token. Examples of such chains include Celo
with CELO, Polygon with MATIC, and zkSync Era with ETH. There is a caveat concerning
MATIC on Polygon and ETH on zkSync Era: while it is possible to manipulate balance deltas,
we have not found a way to withdraw them from the pool since the former has the ERC-20
transfer function that fails if msg.value != value and the latter does not have the ERC-20
transfer function at all. However, there is a way to withdraw CELO on Celo from the pool.
To demonstrate the vulnerability, we will use the CELO token as an example. The attack
consists of two phases: manipulate the balance deltas and take the tokens out of the pool
using these deltas.
The attacker starts with 1000 CELO. To manipulate the balance deltas to their advantage, they
would perform the following steps within a single transaction.
1. Call manager.sync(0x471ece3750da237f93b8e339c536989b8978a438), where
0x471ece3750da237f93b8e339c536989b8978a438 is the address of the CELO
token and manager is the PoolManager contract. This loads the current CELO
balance of manager to transient storage.
2. Call manager.settle{value: 1000}(address(0x0)), which increases the
address(0x0) balance delta of the attacker by 1000 and transfers 1000 CELO to
manager.
Uniswap v4 Core Audit − Critical Severity − 10

3. Call manager.settle(0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438),
which increases the 0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438 balance
delta of the attacker by 1000 without any need of transferring tokens since the balance
of the CELO token has increased in step 2.
At this point, the attacker has increased their balance deltas by 2000 for 1000 CELO tokens. To
take out the profit, they would perform the following steps within the same transaction.
1. Call manager.take(0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438,
address(0x1337), 1000), where address(0x1337) is the attacker's address.
This decreases the 0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438 balance
delta by 1000 and transfers 1000 CELO tokens to the attacker via the ERC-20
transfer function.
2. Call manager.take(address(0x0), address(0x1337), 1000), which
decreases the address(0x0) balance delta by 1000 and transfers 1000 CELO tokens
to the attacker via the value attached to the call. Even though there might be no pool
with the native currency, this step still works because the take function just performs a
call with a value attached. Since the CELO balance is there, the call succeeds.
The attacker has 2000 CELO and zero balance deltas, allowing them to finish the transaction
with a profit of 1000 CELO. By repeating the steps above, it is possible to completely drain the
native currency pool.
Note that, at first glance, a native token with an ERC-20 representation might look like a double
entry point ERC-20 token from the perspective of this issue. However, there is an important
difference: double entry point ERC-20 tokens, along with other non-standard ERC-20 tokens,
are not supported by Uniswap v4, as explicitly stated by the Uniswap team. Native tokens,
however, are supported since they are considered safe and are preferred due to gas savings.
Consider changing the way native currency pools work on chains where the native currency
has a corresponding ERC-20 token. For example, make the NATIVE variable immutable and
set it to the ERC-20 token address for chains where native currency has a corresponding
ERC-20 token.
Update: Resolved in pull request #779. The team re-worked how sync and settle work.
Whenever a sync is called, the very next settle call will settle the previously synced
currency, otherwise the transaction will revert. This makes this attack impossible now, because
one wouldn't be able to settle the native currency (point 2) before settling the corresponding
ERC-20 version (point 3).
Uniswap v4 Core Audit − Critical Severity − 11

Medium Severity
M-01 Unsafe Assembly Blocks
Throughout the codebase, some assembly blocks that are marked as safe do not follow the
Solidity memory model outlined in the Memory Safety section of the Solidity documentation.
This might lead to incorrect and undefined behavior.
• In Hooks.sol, on lines 138-139, the return data can be longer than 64 bytes, thus
potentially overriding the free memory pointer. This might happen if hooks return more
than 64 bytes. For example, the beforeSwap hook returns three values, which means
that it will require 32 * 3 = 96 bytes as ABI-encoding allocates 32 bytes for each
value, which exceeds the scratch space.
• In TickBitmap.sol, on lines 55-60, the error signature and parameters take 96 bytes,
which is more than the scratch space.
• In CustomRevert.sol, on lines 45-63, the error signature and parameters take 96
bytes, which is more than the scratch space.
• In Currency.sol, on lines 52-53, the top 4 bytes of the free memory pointer are
overridden.
Consider removing the memory-safe annotations from assembly blocks that do not follow
the Solidity memory model. Alternatively, consider adjusting the assembly blocks to follow the
memory model.
Update: Resolved in pull request #759.
M-02 ProtocolFeeController Gas Griefing
The ProtocolFees contract implements the logic of retrieving a fee from the
protocolFeeController external contract. The call to protocolFeeController is
limited by the defined controllerGasLimit value. In case the call fails (e.g., by consuming
all the gas), the returned value of the fee is 0. However, a malicious
protocolFeeController can execute a gas griefing attack by returning a large amount of
data that will be implicitly loaded into memory, thereby significantly increasing the gas cost or
even preventing the transaction from executing. Considering how important it is for the
Uniswap team to build unstoppable and permissionless code, this might represent a threat to
the protocol.
Uniswap v4 Core Audit − Medium Severity − 12

Consider using assembly to execute the call and manually copy only 32 bytes from the return
data to memory.
Update: Resolved in pull request #771.
M-03 Front-Running Pool's Initialization or Initial
Deposit Can Lead to Draining Initial Liquidity
The pool's sqrtPriceX96 can be manipulated either by front-running the initialization of the
pool or by an initial deposit of liquidity. The initialize function allows initializing a pool whose
stored ID is obtained by conversion of the PoolKey struct that is passed as an argument in the
function call. Since the sqrtPriceX96 is never used for the ID calculation, anyone can front-
run the initialization function call and provide their own value for sqrtPriceX96, which will
then be used for setting the tick.
Another way to manipulate the sqrtPriceX96 is by front-running the initial deposit of a
recently initialized pool. The swap function does not check for liquidity before a swap occurs
and, if this happens, the sqrtPriceX96 value stored will change. Consequently, a malicious
actor can move the sqrtPriceX96 of the pool to any value if the current position has zero
liquidity. As a result, to take advantage of the LP's liquidity, an attacker could manipulate the
sqrtPriceX96 right after the pool initialization and before any deposit is done, establishing a
different price in the pool that does not reflect the market price, thereby opening it up to
arbitrage opportunities.
The aforementioned two cases lead to an exploitation scenario that allows draining the initial
liquidity if it is performed on a separate transaction from the one that initializes the pool. In the
case of front-running the initial liquidity deposit, consider the following scenario:
1. The LP creates a new pool and sets sqrtPriceX96 to
79228162514264337593543950336 (1 tokenA per 1 tokenB).
2. The LP calls modifyLiquidity to add liquidity to the pool for the price range 0.5
<=> 3.
3. The attacker calls the swap function to move the sqrtPriceX96 to a random high
value before the LP's modifyLiquidity transaction is executed.
4. The LP's modifyLiquidity transaction is then executed and liquidity is added.
5. Now, the attacker can swap 1 tokenA for 3 tokenB using the LP's liquidity.
In the case of front-running the pool's initialization, one could front-run step 1 of the above
scenario so that the LP creation fails (because it will be already initialized by the front-runner)
and then skip step 3. This will lead to the same result.
Uniswap v4 Core Audit − Medium Severity − 13

Consider documenting this issue, specifically, the fact that the initialization of a pool can be
front-run. In addition, consider whether it should be allowed for a swap to occur with no
liquidity at all in the pool or whether it makes sense to provide initialization with initial liquidity
within the same transaction. Under the assumption that the PoolManager contract will be
used through periphery contracts, this issue is not easy to exploit. However, such an
assumption might not hold in some circumstances, making the issue more severe.
Update: Acknowledged, not resolved. The team stated:
This attack vector is prevented by peripheral contracts adding slippage protection when
users add liquidity to a pool.
Low Severity
L-01 Unsafe ABI Encoding
It is not uncommon to use abi.encodeWithSignature or abi.encodeWithSelector to
generate calldata for a low-level call. However, the first option is not typo-safe and the second
option is not type-safe. As such, both of these methods are error-prone and ought to be
considered unsafe.
Within Hooks.sol, there are multiple uses of unsafe ABI encodings:
• The use of abi.encodeWithSelector within beforeInitialize function
• The use of abi.encodeWithSelector within afterInitialize function
• The use of abi.encodeWithSelector within beforeModifyLiquidity function
• The use of abi.encodeWithSelector within beforeModifyLiquidity function
• The use of abi.encodeWithSelector within beforeDonate function
• The use of abi.encodeWithSelector within afterDonate function
Consider replacing all the occurrences of unsafe ABI encodings with abi.encodeCall which
checks whether the supplied values actually match the types expected by the called function
and also avoids errors caused by typos.
Update: Resolved in pull request #770.
Uniswap v4 Core Audit − Low Severity − 14

L-02 Missing Error Messages in require
Statements
Throughout the codebase, there are require statements that lack error messages:
• The require statement in line 14 of BitMath.sol
• The require statement in line 56 of BitMath.sol
• The require statement in line 30 of FullMath.sol
• The require statement in line 113 of FullMath.sol
To improve overall code clarity and facilitate troubleshooting, consider including specific,
informative error messages in require statements. Alternatively, consider using custom
errors to maintain consistency throughout the codebase.
Update: Acknowledged, not resolved.
L-03 Unsafe Casting
CurrencyLibrary creates currency by using the fromId function which creates a currency
address from a uint256 value. This might lead to unsafe casting within the mint or burn
functions. While this feature might be interesting as it allows traders to create some form of
namespaces for the tokens, it could lead to issues during third-party integrations. The
corresponding toId function converts the currency into an ID by casting the currency
address into a uint256. This means that while the functions fromId and toId are
expected to be inverse functions, they are not, since the upper 12 bytes are lost during the
conversion to currency in the fromId function.
Consider masking the upper bits in the mint and burn functions to ensure the uint256 ID
value fits into uint160. Alternatively, consider thoroughly documenting this behavior.
Update: Resolved in pull request #776. The team decided to add a bit masking to the fromId
function so that upper 12 bytes are always shaved off from the id.

Notes & Additional
Information
N-01 Inconsistent Use of Multiple Solidity
Versions
The protocol is inconsistently using multiple Solidity versions. As such, the following issues
have been identified:
• There are multiple contracts with floating pragmas such as in ERC6909.sol.
• There are pragma statements that use an outdated version of Solidity such as in
Extsload.sol and IExtsload.sol.
• There are contracts such as CustomRevert.sol or ERC6909 that use a pragma
statement that spans several minor Solidity versions. This can lead to unpredictable
behavior due to differences in features, bug fixes, deprecations, and compatibility
between minor versions.
Consider pinning the Solidity version more specifically throughout the codebase to ensure
predictable behavior and maintain compatibility across various compilers. It is recommended
to take advantage of the latest Solidity version to improve the overall readability and security of
the codebase. Regardless of which version of Solidity is used, consistently pin the version
throughout the codebase to prevent bugs caused by incompatible future releases.
Update: Resolved in pull request #784. The team addressed standardization. The code has
been changed to reflect version ^0.8.0 for any imported contract, library or interface in order
to allow integrators flexibility. Contracts that rely on transient storage are marked with version
^0.8.24 while PoolManager, which will be the main contract, has been set to a specific
0.8.26 version.
N-02 Lack of memory-safe Annotation in
Assembly Blocks
In the codebase, there is extensive use of the memory-safe annotation for assembly blocks.
However, the BalanceDelta and BeforeSwapDelta types are missing this annotation.
Consider being consistent with the use of the memory-safe annotation.
Uniswap v4 Core Audit − Notes & Additional Information − 16

Update: Resolved in pull request #778.
N-03 Discrepancy Between Implementation and
Specification of ERC-6909
There is a discrepancy between the implementation of the ERC-6909 transferFrom
function and its specification. In particular, the specification states that it MUST revert when
the caller is not an operator for the sender and the caller's allowance for the token id for
the sender is insufficient. This implies that if sender is msg.sender and they did not set
themselves as an operator then transferFrom should revert. However, this is not the case
as transferFrom skips operator and allowance checks in such a case.
Consider adjusting the implementation to follow the specification. Alternatively, consider
adjusting the specification if this is a desirable property.
Update: The team reached out to the EIP-6909 creators and a fix was pushed to the
specitifcation.
N-04 Code Clarity
In the Pool contract, there are several places which might benefit from slight refactoring.
• !exactInput can be turned into just exactInput if the true and false branches
are swapped.
• !zeroForOne can be turned into just zeroForOne if the true and false branches
are swapped.
• state.amountCalculated can use compound operators to shorten the expressions.
Consider refactoring the above to improve code readability.
Update: Partially resolved in pull request #777. Only the third item has been addressed.
N-05 Missing Function Parameters Names
Multiple functions declared in the IProtocolFees interface are missing parameter names.
This makes the code less clear and more difficult to understand.
Consider naming all function parameters.
Uniswap v4 Core Audit − Notes & Additional Information − 17

Update: Resolved in pull request #772.
N-06 Discrepancies Between Interfaces And
Implementation Contracts
Throughout the codebase, multiple discrepancies have been identified between interfaces and
implementation contracts.
• Within the IExtsload interface, the first parameter of the extsload function is called
slot whereas in the implementation contract, startSlot is used.
• Within the IERC6909Claims interface, the first parameter of the setOperator
function is called spender whereas in the implementation contract, operator is
used.
• Within the IPoolManager interface, the parameter of the settle function is called
token whereas in the implementation contract, currency is used.
Consider using the same parameter names across interfaces and implementation contracts.
Update: Resolved in pull request #762.
N-07 Unused Named Return Variables
Named return variables are a way to declare variables that are meant to be used within a
function's body for the purpose of being returned as that function's output. They are an
alternative to explicit in-line return statements.
Throughout the codebase, there are unused named return variables:
• The delta return variable in the callHookWithReturnDelta function in
Hooks.sol
• The sqrtQX96 return variable in the getNextSqrtPriceFromInput function in
SqrtPriceMath.sol
• The sqrtQX96 return variable in the getNextSqrtPriceFromOutput function in
SqrtPriceMath.sol
• The amount0 return variable in the getAmount0Delta function in
SqrtPriceMath.sol
• The amount0 return variable in the secondary getAmount0Delta function in
SqrtPriceMath.sol
Uniswap v4 Core Audit − Notes & Additional Information − 18

• The amount1 return variable in the getAmount1Delta function in
SqrtPriceMath.sol
• The slot return variable in the _getPositionInfoSlot function in
StateLibrary.sol
Consider either using or removing any unused named return variables.
Update: Resolved in pull request #758.
N-08 Unused Imports
Throughout the codebase, there are imports that are unused and could be removed:
• The import import {BalanceDelta} from "./BalanceDelta.sol"; imports
unused alias BalanceDelta in BeforeSwapDelta.sol.
• The import import {Pool} from "../libraries/Pool.sol"; imports unused

N-09 Unused Error
The TickNotInitialized error in Pool.sol is defined but never used.
To improve the overall clarity and readability of the codebase, consider either using or

Update: Resolved in pull request #764.
N-10 Magic Numbers
Throughout the codebase, there are a few instances where literal values are used directly for

In order to improve code readability, consider using a constant to define such values and
document its purpose.
Update: Acknowledged, not resolved.
N-11 State Variable Visibility Not Explicitly
Declared
Throughout the codebase, there are state variables that lack an explicitly declared visibility:
• The IS_UNLOCKED_SLOT state variable in Lock.sol
• The NONZERO_DELTA_COUNT_SLOT state variable in NonZeroDeltaCount.sol
• The RESERVES_OF_SLOT state variable in Reserves.sol
For clarity, consider always explicitly declaring the visibility of variables, even when the default
visibility matches the intended visibility.
Update: Resolved in pull request #766.

N-12 Missing Named Parameters in Mappings
Since Solidity 0.8.18, developers can utilize named parameters in mappings. This means
mappings can take the form of mapping(KeyType KeyName? => ValueType
ValueName?). This updated syntax provides a more transparent representation of a
mapping's purpose.
Within ERC6909.sol, there are multiple mappings without named parameters:
• The isOperator state variable
• The balanceOf state variable
• The allowance state variable
Consider adding named parameters to mappings in order to improve the readability and
maintainability of the codebase.
Update: Resolved in pull request #767.
N-13 Lack of Indexed Event Parameter
Within IProtocolFees.sol, the ProtocolFeeControllerUpdated event does not
have an indexed parameter.
To improve the ability of off-chain services to search and filter for specific events, consider
indexing event parameters.
Update: Resolved in pull request #768.
N-14 Missing Docstrings
Throughout the codebase, there are multiple code instances that do not have docstrings:
• The OperatorSet, Approval and Transfer events, the isOperator,
balanceOf and allowance state variables, and the transfer, transferFrom,
approve, setOperator and supportsInterface functions in ERC6909.sol
• The IERC6909Claims interface in IERC6909Claims.sol
• The IExtsload interface and the IExttload interface in IExtsload.sol
• The IPoolManager interface in IPoolManager.sol
• The IProtocolFeeController interface in IProtocolFeeController.sol

BeforeSwapDelta.sol
• The NATIVE state variable in Currency.sol
Consider thoroughly documenting all functions (and their parameters) that are part of any
contract's public API. Functions implementing sensitive functionality, even if not public, should
be clearly documented as well. When writing docstrings, consider following the Ethereum
Natural Specification Format (NatSpec).
Update: Partially resolved in pull request #773. Only the first item of the list has not been
addressed.
N-15 Incomplete Docstrings
Throughout the codebase, there are several instances of incomplete docstrings:
• The return value is not documented for the transfer, transferFrom, approve,
setOperator functions in IERC6909Claims.sol.

• The delta parameter is not documented for the afterAddLiquidity and
afterRemoveLiquidity functions in IHooks.sol.
• The return value is not documented for the MAX_TICK_SPACING and
MIN_TICK_SPACING functions in IPoolManager.sol.

N-16 Lack of Security Contact
Providing a specific security contact (such as an email or ENS name) within a smart contract
significantly simplifies the process for individuals to communicate if they identify a vulnerability
in the code. This practice is quite beneficial as it permits the code owners to dictate the
communication channel for vulnerability disclosure, eliminating the risk of miscommunication
or failure to report due to a lack of knowledge on how to do so. In addition, if the contract
incorporates third-party libraries and a bug surfaces in those, it becomes easier for their
maintainers to contact the appropriate person about the problem and provide mitigation
instructions.
Throughout the codebase, all contracts do not have a security contact specified.
Consider adding a NatSpec comment containing a security contact above each contract
definition. Using the @custom:security-contact convention is recommended as it has
been adopted by the OpenZeppelin Wizard and the ethereum-lists.
Update: Resolved in pull request #774. The team decided to create a SECURITY.md
markdown file in the root of the project repository with the necessary security contacts.
Client Reported
CR-01 License Limitation Can Be Skipped
The purpose of the noDelegateCall modifier in the unlock function is to prevent proxy
contracts from making delegate calls to the Uniswap v4 core contracts. This restriction is
mainly due to license limitations. However, during the audit, the team was notified that this
limitation can be bypassed by creating a custom contract that implements the same unlock
function and writes to the same slot for the lock value, thereby allowing delegate calls to all
other external functions, effectively circumventing the restriction.
The Uniswap team might consider adding the noDelegateCall modifier to all external
functions, rather than only using it in the unlock function.
Update: Resolved in pull request #743. The team added the noDelegateCall modifier to all
relevant external functions.

Conclusion
Uniswap v4 is an AMM that uses the concentrated liquidity model by default and can
customize the model along with other parts of the protocol through the use of hooks. It also
introduces singleton architecture, flash accounting, dynamic liquidity providers fee, donation to
liquidity providers, and native token support.
One critical- and several medium-severity vulnerabilities were discovered along with some
other issues of lower severity. In addition, suggestions were also made to improve the
readability and clarity of the codebase in order to facilitate future audits and development. The
codebase was found to be robust and generally well-documented. However, extensive use of
assembly and other optimization techniques has significantly increased code complexity,
thereby leaving room for undiscovered issues.
The Uniswap team was exceptionally responsive and provided us with extensive
documentation about the project.
